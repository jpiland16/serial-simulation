To install the `three.py` library, please follow the installation instructions at [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/three-py-packaged/).

You will also need to install `pyserial` and `opencv-python`.

#### Important note ####

The installable version of `three.py` sometimes exhibits color issues when run from a Spyder terminal. Running from a system terminal can resolve this issue.
